    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Pizza is the star of the fast-food world, and it’s many people’s go-to meal when they fancy a little slice of happiness on a Friday night.</p>
    <p>It’s also the one dish that many people think that those on a vegan diet miss out on due to its cheesy toppings. But as we all know, that couldn’t be further from the truth!</p>
    <p>There are so many ways to get creative with vegan pizza recipes as you can customize every element from the cheese and toppings right down to the base.</p>
    <p>You can opt for a more traditional dough to create your base or even try something new by adding in veggies and chia seeds to add flavour and texture.</p>
